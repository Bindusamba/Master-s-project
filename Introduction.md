The iProm-Sigma54 project enhances a CNN-based tool for identifying Ïƒ54 promoters by incorporating RNA Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer architectures. This upgrade replaces the original one-hot encoding with richer, contextualized embeddings, enabling the model to recognize complex DNA sequence patterns more effectively. The project also implements an ensemble approach using Random Forest and XGBoost models to improve robustness and reduce misclassifications, ultimately aiming to surpass the performance of existing methods in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
